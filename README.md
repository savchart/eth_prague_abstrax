Abstrax
Abstrax is a platform built on top of ERC-4337 that allows users to extend the behavior of their smart contracts. Users can create and deploy their own smart contracts, and integrate them into the Abstrax platform for enhanced functionality.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js
Yarn
Getting Started
To set up and run the Abstrax platform, follow these steps:

Clone the Abstrax repository:
`git clone https://github.com/savchart/eth_prague_abstrax`
Navigate to the project directory:
`cd directory_name`
Install the project dependencies:
`yarn install`
Start the development server:
`yarn dev`
This will start the Abstrax platform on your local development environment.

Usage
Creating a Smart Contract
In the Abstrax platform, navigate to the "Create Contract" section.
Enter the Solidity code for your smart contract in the provided editor.
Set any necessary constructor parameters for your contract.
Click the "Deploy" button to deploy your contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
Integrating a Smart Contract
In the Abstrax platform, navigate to the "Integrate Contract" section.
Provide the address of the smart contract you want to integrate.
Specify any additional configuration or parameters required for integration.
Click the "Integrate" button to add the smart contract to your Abstrax profile.
Extending Smart Contract Behavior
In the Abstrax platform, navigate to the "Extend Contract" section.
Select the smart contract you want to extend from your Abstrax profile.
Write custom logic or additional functions to enhance the contract's behavior.
Click the "Extend" button to update and deploy the extended contract to the blockchain.
Managing Contracts
In the Abstrax platform, navigate to the "Manage Contracts" section.
View a list of all your integrated and extended contracts.
Perform actions such as upgrading, disabling, or removing contracts.
